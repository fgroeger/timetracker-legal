# TimeTracker Privacy

While developing TimeTracker, I focused on keeping your information private. The app only uses the standard analytics from Apple (App Store). Otherwise, I do not collect any information. Your working times are saved in your iCloud. Refer to the iCloud privacy policy for more detail.
